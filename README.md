# Transition(s) 2050 / ADEME
Implementation of French prospective scenarios from ADEME study "Transition(s) 2050" into ecoinvent database with premise


What does this repository do ?
-----------

This is a repository containing the implementation of prospective scenarios for France into ecoinvent. 
The prospective scenarios are provided in the "Transition(s) 2050" study by the French Agency for Ecological Transition - ADEME.   
The scope of ADEME prospective study is France, from now to 2050, and covers most of the economic sectors.
This repository does not cover the whole scope of ADEME study and creates market-specific activities in the LCA database ecoinvent for the following sectors in France:
* electricity
* hydrogen
* gas

The evolution at the regional scale are modeled by coupling the French scenarios with a global scenario provided by an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM).



ADEME prospective study 
------------------------

Prospective scenarios are extracted from the study : Transition(s) 2050, ADEME, 2021\
[`Website`](https://www.ademe.fr/les-futurs-en-transition/) \
[`Full Report`](https://librairie.ademe.fr/recherche-et-innovation/5072-prospective-transitions-2050-rapport.html) \
[`Data repository`](https://data-transitions2050.ademe.fr/)

ADEME provides 5 scenarios : 
* S1 : Frugal generation (Génération Frugale) > The transition is driven mostly by sobriety and constraint.
* S2 : Territorial cooperation (Coopération territoriale) > The society transformation is based on a shared governance and on territorialization strategies.
* S3 Renew : Green technologies based on renewables development (Technologies vertes) > The transition is based on innovation and development of low carbon technologies, especially renewable energies.  
* S3 Nuc : Green technologies based on nuclear development (Technologies vertes) > The transition is based on innovation and development of low carbon technologies, especially nuclear energy.  
* S4 : Repairing bet (Pari réparateur) > The transition relies highly on new technologies development, without any society lifestyle changes.

How is the repository organized ?
-----------

This repository is meant to be used with the open-source python library [`premise`](https://github.com/polca/premise), using the [`user-defined scenario functionnality`](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_scenarios.html).
The data relating to the annual production volumes of different energy carriers 
(e.g. electricity, hydrogen) for each scenario 
have been formatted and organised in a data package defined by the Frictionless standards 
(Walsh and Pollock, 2022). This data package is read and interpreted by `premise`. 
We therefore store a number of scenarios in a single data package.

This datapackage contains four files necessary to the scenarios implementation into the ecoinvent LCA database: 

* A datapackage.json file, which provides the metadata for the data package (e.g. authors, scenario descriptions, list and locations of resources, etc.). 
* A config.yaml file which provides the correspondence between the scenario variables and the LCA datasets in the ecoinvent DB, as well as the additional "LCA datasets" when they are not available in the ecoinvent database. 
* A tabular data file containing the time series for each variable in the set of scenarios. 
* An optional Excel file containing the LCA inventories of the additional "LCA datasets" for any technology not initially present in the ecoinvent database. 

Additionally, a pdf document called "supplementary information" presents the methodological choices that where made to build this model.


How to use this notebook ?
------------------
* 0. Prerequisites: ecoinvent licence
* 1. Install the environment as explained [`here`](https://github.com/polca/premise?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install-this-package).
  Use premise version => 2.2.6
* 2. Create a brightway project and load ecoinvent database in the project. It can be done using [`ecoinvent_interface`](https://github.com/brightway-lca/ecoinvent_interface).
* 3. Run the script 'run-premise-ademe.md'
  
A prospective version of ecoinvent is generated for each combination of : Year x IAM model x IAM scenario x French scenario. You can choose the combination you want to compute in 'run-premise-ademe.md' file. \
The newly created market datasets are tagged with 'Tr2050', for example : `market for electricity, high voltage, Tr2050` (FR) or `market for hydrogen, gaseous, Tr2050` 

Ecoinvent database compatibility
--------------------------------
ecoinvent 3.9.1 cut-off

IAM scenario compatibility
---------------------------
The user can couple each French scenario with a global scenario (IAM) provided by premise.\
The available IAM scenarios provided by premise can be explored [`here`](https://premisedash-6f5a0259c487.herokuapp.com/)\
The choice of IAM scenario is under the responsability of the user of this repository. However, the authors highlight the fact that the impact results highly depends on the IAM scenario chosen. The authors advice to couple the scenarios with RCP 4.5 scenarios or with scenarios whose temperature increase are similar to RCP 4.5 scenarios, as these scenarios are probably the most representative of the current trends.
